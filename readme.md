# API Logic Server Sample Tutorial

Welcome to API Logic Server - thanks for giving it a try!

This is the sample app.  It was created from the pre-installed sqlite [Northwind database](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Sample-Database/) (Customer, Order, OrderDetail, Product, etc.).

In this tutorial, we will explore:

1. **Create** - we will briefly review what actually happened during the create process.

2. **Run** - we will first run the Admin App and the JSON:API.  These will illustrate how automation creates an app and API from a database.  Use this to infer what you'd get for one of your databases.

3. **Customize** - we will then explore customizing and debugging the project.

&nbsp;

### Key Underlying Concepts
This tutorial illustrates some key concepts:

#### _Declarative Models_, not code
Observe that the files for the Admin App and API are models that describe _what, not how_.  This level of abstratction is much easier to understand than large amounts of generated code.

##### Automated Automation
Not only do models automate functionality, the *models themselves* are automated, created instantly when you create a project.  That means you have instant Working Software.

#### Customize - using standard tools
The system is designed for you to customize the UI, Logic, Security and API, using standard tools - your IDE for code editing / debugging, git, etc.

#### Iterate - Preserve Customizations
The system is designed to enable `rebuild`, so you can iterate the data model - _without losing your customizations._  In general, such customizations are kept in separate files from the model files.  So, the model files can be rebuilt without affecting customization files.

#### Logic Automation
A unique feature of API Logic Server is provision for spreadsheet-like rules, customizable with Python.  Rules address update logic (multi-table derivations and constraints), and security (authorization).

&nbsp;&nbsp;

# Development Overview

[![Using VS Code](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/creates-and-runs-video.png?raw=true)](https://youtu.be/tOojjEAct4M "Using VS Code with the ApiLogicServer container - click for video")

The diagram above summarizes the create / run / customize process.

> It's a video - click to view.

&nbsp;

## 1. Create: Instant Project

The CLI command below creates an `ApiLogicProject` by reading your schema.  

Note: the `db_url` value is defaulted to the pre-installed sample project; you would normally supply a SQLAlchemy URL.  

```bash
$ ApiLogicServer create --project_name= --db_url=    # create ApiLogicProject
```
&nbsp;

## 2. Run

You can then open the project in your IDE, and run it as follows:

1. **Create `venv`:** as shown in the [Readme](Readme.md#1-setup-and-run) ***(not required for VSCode or Docker)***

2. **Start the Server:** F5 (PyCharm: Ctl-D).

3. **Start the Admin App:** either use the links provided in the IDE console, or click [http://localhost:5656/](http://localhost:5656/).  The screen shown below should appear in your Browser.

The system has created an API and an Admin App.  Let's explore them.


### 2.a Self-Serve API: Ad hoc Integration

The system creates a JSON:API with end points for each table, providing filtering, sorting, pagination, optimistic locking and related data access.

The API is [**self-serve**](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/API-Self-Serve/): consumers can select their own attributes and related data, eliminating reliance on custom API development.  Our self-serve API meets requirements for Ad Hoc Application Integration, and Custom UI Dev.

<img src="https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/integration/api-swagger.jpeg?raw=true">

### 2.b Admin App: Multi-Page, Multi-Table, Automatic Joins

The `create` command also creates an Admin App: multi-page, multi-table with automatic joins -- ready for **[business user agile collaboration](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Tech-AI/),** and back office data maintenance.  This complements custom UIs you can create with the API.

After starting the server and browser, explore the Admin App in your browser:

1. Navigate to `Customer`
      * Depending on your screen size, you may need to hit the "hamburger menu" (top left) to see the left menu<br/><br/>
2. Click the first Customer row  to see Customer Details
3. Click the `ORDERLIST` tab at the bottom
4. Click the first Order row
5. Observe the `ORDERDETAILLIST` tab at the bottom
6. Observe the elements shown in the diagram

      * Multi-Page - 2 pages for each table (list, with search, and display)
      * Multi-Table - database relationships (typically from foreign keys) used to build master/detail pages
      * Automatic Joins - the Order Detail table contains `ProductId`, but the system has joined in the `Product Name`.  You can edit the `admin.yaml` file to control such behavior.

![run-admin-app](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/ui-admin/run-admin-app.png?raw=true)

> **Key Takeaway: *Microservice Automation***<br>With **1 command**, we have created an executable project with a **self-serve API**, for ad hoc application integration and custom UI development.  Our **Admin App** can be used for agile business user collaboration.

&nbsp;

## 3. Customize and Debug: in your IDE

While API/UI automation is a great start, we now require Custom APIs, Logic and Security.

You normally apply such customizations using your IDE, leveraging code completion, etc.  To accelerate this sample, you can apply the customizations with `ApiLogicServer add-cust`.   We'll review the customizations below.

<details markdown>

<summary> Show me how -- apply customizations </summary>

&nbsp;

The following `add-cust` process simulates:

* Adding security to your project using a CLI command, and
* Using your IDE to:

    * declare logic in `logic/declare_logic.sh`
    * declare security in `security/declare_security.py`
    * implement custom APIs in `api/customize_api.py`, using <br>`OrderShipping` declared in `integration/row_dict_maps`

> These customizations are shown in the screenshots below.

To apply customizations, in a terminal window for your project:

**1. Stop the Server** (Red Stop button, or Shift-F5 -- see Appendix)

**2. Apply Customizations:** in the terminal window of your IDE:

```bash
ApiLogicServer add-cust
ApiLogicServer add-auth --db_url=auth  # version 10.3.14 or greater
```

**3. Restart the server, login as `admin`**

</details>

<br>

In the sections below, we will explore:

* a. UI Customizations
* b. Logic Customizations
* c. Security Customizations
* d. Application Integration Customizations

### 3.a Customize UI: Declare UI Behavior

The admin app is not built with complex html and javascript.  Instead, it is *configured* with  `ui/admin/admin.yml`, automatically created from your data model by `ApiLogicServer create`.

You can customize this file in your IDE to control which fields are shown (including joins), hide/show conditions, help text etc.  The `add-cust` process above has simulated such customizations.

To see customized Admin app in action, with the restarted server:

**1. Start the Admin App:** [http://localhost:5656/](http://localhost:5656/)

**2. Login** as `ALFKI`, password `p`

**3. Click Customers**

**4. Click the first Customer**

**5. Click `Add New Order`** (bottom of page)

**6. Click `Employee` and choose the first one**

**7. Click `SAVE AND SHOW`**

**8. Click `ADD NEW ORDER DETAIL`**

**9. Lookup `CHAI` and enter an excessive Quantity** as shown below

One customization has been to hide several Order fields (search `ui/admin/admin.yml` for `show_when: isInserting == false`).  This makes it convenient to use the Admin App to enter an Order and OrderDetails:

<img src="https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/integration/order-entry-ui.jpg?raw=true">

&nbsp;

Note the automation for **automatic joins** (Product Name, not ProductId) and **lookups** (select from a list of Products to obtain the foreign key).  If we attempt to order too much Chai, the transaction properly fails due to the Check Credit rules, described below.

&nbsp;

### 3.b Customize Logic: Declare Check Credit Rules

Such logic (multi-table derivations and constraints) is a significant portion of a system, typically nearly half.  API Logic server provides **spreadsheet-like rules** that dramatically simplify and accelerate logic development.


#### IDE: Declare and Debug

The 5 check credit rules are shown below in `logic/declare_logic.py`.  

> Rules are 40X more concise than legacy code, as [shown here](https://github.com/valhuber/LogicBank/wiki/by-code).

Rules are declared in Python, simplified with IDE code completion.  The `add-cust` process above has simulated the process of using your IDE to declare logic.

Observe rules can be debugged using standard logging and the debugger:

<img src="https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/integration/logic-chaining.jpeg?raw=true">

&nbsp;

Rules operate by handling SQLAlchemy events, so apply to all ORM access, whether by the api engine, or your custom code.  Once declared, you don't need to remember to call them, which promotes quality.

The rules shown above prevented the too-big order with *multi-table logic* to copy the Product Price, compute the Amount, roll it up to the AmountTotal and Balance, and check the CreditLimit.  

These same rules also govern changing orders, deleting them, picking different parts - about 9 transactions, all automated.  Implementing all this by hand would otherwise require about 200 lines of code.<br><br>


#### Agility, Quality

Rules are a unique and significant innovation, providing meaningful improvements over procedural logic:

| CHARACTERISTIC | PROCEDURAL | DECLARATIVE | WHY IT MATTERS |
| :--- |:---|:---|:---|
| **Reuse** | Not Automatic | Automatic - all Use Cases | **40X Code Reduction** |
| **Invocation** | Passive - only if called  | Active - call not required | Quality |
| **Ordering** | Manual | Automatic | Agile Maintenance |
| **Optimizations** |Manual | Automatic | Agile Design |

&nbsp;

> **Key Takeway -  Logic:** Multi-table Derivations and Constraint Rules, Extensible with Python 
<br><br>Rules are:
<br>1. **Declared** in your IDE - 40X more concise
<br>2. **Activated** on server start
<br>3. **Executed** - *automatically* -  on updates (using SQLAlchemy events)
<br>4. **Debugged** in your IDE, and with the console log
<br><br>For more on rules, [click here](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Logic-Why/).

&nbsp;

### 3.c Customize Security: Declare Grants

The `add-cust` process above has simulated the `ApiLogicServer add-auth` command, and using your IDE to declare security in `logic/declare_security.sh`.

To see security in action:

**1. Logout (upper right), and Login** as `AFLKI`, password `p`

    * This authorized user has 2 roles: `customer` and 'tenant`

**2. Click Customer** - observe you now see only 1 customer (per the `customer` role)

<br>

#### Login, Row Filtering

Declarative row-level security ensures that users see only the rows authorized for their roles.  Observe you now see only customer ALFKI, per the security declared below.  Note the console log at the bottom shows how the filter worked.

<img src="https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/integration/security-filters.jpg?raw=true">

&nbsp;

> **Key Takeway** -  Row-Level Security: Customers Filtered

&nbsp;

### 3.d Application Integration: B2B and Shipping

We now have a running system - an API, logic, security, and a UI.  Now let's see how integrate with:

* ***Incoming* B2B partners:** we'll create a **B2B Custom Resource**
* ***Outgoing* OrderShipping:** we add logic to **Send an OrderShipping Message**

&nbsp;

#### B2B Custom Resource

The self-serve API does not conform to the format required for a B2B partnership.  We need to create a custom resource.

You can create custom resources by editing `customize_api.py`, using standard Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy.  A custom `OrderB2B` resource is shown below.

The main task here is to ***map*** a B2B payload onto our logic-enabled SQLAlchemy rows.  API Logic Server provides a declarative `RowDictMapper` class you can use as follows:

1. Declare the mapping -- see the `OrderB2B` class in the lower pane

    * Note the support for **lookup**, so partners can send ProductNames, not ProductIds

2. Create the custom API endpoint -- see the upper pane:

    * Add `def OrderB2B` to `customize_api/py` to create a new endpoint
    * Use the `OrderB2B` class to transform a api request data to SQLAlchemy rows (`dict_to_row`)
    * The automatic commit initiates the same shared logic described above to check credit and reorder products

![dict to row](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/integration/dict-to-row.jpg?raw=true)


&nbsp;
> **Key Takeway -  Custom Endpoint - 7 lines of code**<br>So, our custom endpoint required about 7 lines of code, along with the API specification.  We use standard Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy.  Note the **logic is automatically factored out,** and re-used for all APIs, both custom and self-serve.

&nbsp;

#### Produce `OrderShipping` Message

Successful orders need to be sent to Shipping, again in a predesignated format.

We could certainly POST an API, but Messaging (here, Kafka) provides significant advantages:

* **Async:** Our system will not be impacted if the Shipping system is down.  Kafka will save the message, and deliver it when Shipping is back up.
* **Multi-cast:** We can send a message that multiple systems (e.g., Accounting) can consume.

The content of the message is a JSON string, just like an API.

Just as you can customize apis, you can complement rule-based logic using Python events:

1. Declare the mapping -- see the `OrderShipping` class in the right pane.  This formats our Kafka message content in the format agreed upon with Shipping.

2. Define a Python `after_flush` event, which invokes `send_order_to_shipping`.  This is called by the logic engine, which passes the SQLAlchemy `models.Order` row.

3. `send_order_to_shipping` uses the `OrderShipping` class, which maps our SQLAlchemy order row to a dict (`row_to_dict`).

![send order to shipping](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/integration/order-to-shipping.jpg?raw=true)


&nbsp;
> **Key Takeway -  Extensible Rules, Kafka Message Produced**<br>Rule-based logic is extensible with Python, here producing a Kafka message with 20 lines of code.


&nbsp;

### 3.e Customize the Data Model

You can also alter the data model, while preserving customizations.  For more information, see [Database Design Changes](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Database-Changes/).

&nbsp;

## Testing

### Behave

You can test using standard api and ui test tools.  We recommend exploring the [Behave framework](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Behave/).  This can be used as part of an overall agile approach as described in the [Logic Tutorial](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Logic-Tutorial/).

TL;DR - features and test scripts are predefined in the sample; to run them (with the server running):

1. Run Launch Configuration `Behave Run` 
2. Run Launch Configuration ``Behave Logic Report`` 
3. Open `test/api_logic_server_behave/reports/Behave Logic Report.md`

&nbsp;&nbsp;

   > The sample Scenarios below were chosen to illustrate the basic patterns of using rules. Open the disclosure box ("Tests - and their logic...") to see the implementation and notes.   

For more information, see [Testing with Behave](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Behave/).

&nbsp;

### Test it

Use your IDE terminal window to simulate a business partner posting a B2BOrder.  You can set breakpoints in the code described above to explore system operation.

```bash
ApiLogicServer curl "'POST' 'http://localhost:5656/api/ServicesEndPoint/OrderB2B'" --data '
{"meta": {"args": {"order": {
    "AccountId": "ALFKI",
    "Surname": "Buchanan",
    "Given": "Steven",
    "Items": [
        {
        "ProductName": "Chai",
        "QuantityOrdered": 1
        },
        {
        "ProductName": "Chang",
        "QuantityOrdered": 2
        }
        ]
    }
}}}'
```
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# 1. Setup and Run

To run your project, the system requires various runtime systems for data access, api, and logic.  These are included with API Logic Server ([architecture doc here](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Architecture-What-Is/)).  

So, to run your project:

*  __1.1 Establish your Python Environment__ 
    * Docker or VSCode - [nothing to do](#docker-or-vscode---nothing-to-do)
    * Otherwise, [Establish Your Python Environment](#establish-your-python-environment---other-environments) to activate these runtime systems
* __[1.2 Run](#12-run)__

&nbsp;

## 1.1 Establish Your Python Environment - Other Environments

Your `requirements.txt` has already been created, so...

```bash title="Install API Logic Server in a Virtual Environment"
python -m venv venv                        # may require python3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate                      # mac/linux: source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt  # accept "new Virtual environment"
```

Notes:

* See also the `venv_setup` directory in this API Logic Project.

* If using SqlServer, install `pyodbc`.  Not required for docker-based projects.  For local installs, see the [Quick Start](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Install-pyodbc/).

&nbsp;

#### Docker or VSCode - nothing to do

Nothing to do here:

* **VSCode:** projects automatically use installed API Logic Server `venv`, so this step is ***not required*** until you want to create a local `venv` for additional packages.

* **Docker:** Your runtime systems are part of Dev Container, which you probably activated when you [opened the project](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/IDE-Execute/).  

    * If you did not accept the "Open in Container" option when you started VSCode, use __View > Command Palette > Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container__.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## 1.2 Run

The `ApiLogicServer create` command creates Run Configurations for PyCharm and VSCode:

* For PyCharm, press Ctl-D
* For VSCode, &nbsp;press F5:

![Start Project](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/tutorial/2-apilogicproject-nutshell.png?raw=true)

As shown above:

1. Use the pre-supplied Run Configurations; use either...
    * `ApiLogicServer` to run [with security](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Security-Swagger/)
    * `ApiLogicServer - No Security` (simplifies use of Swagger)
2. Click the url in the console to start the Admin App
    * Use it to explore your **data** (shown below)
    * And your **API** (via Swagger)

![Admin App](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/Docs/blob/main/docs/images/ui-admin/run-admin-app.png?raw=true)


&nbsp;

# 2. Key Customization Files

Your project is ready to run, but it's likely you'll want to customize it - declare logic, new endpoints, etc.


<details markdown>

<summary>Important: explore customization examples</summary>
<br>
In particular, use the sample app to explore the value of declarative logic and security.  Unique to API Logic Server, these are critical to unlocking the full value of API Logic Server.

<br>

To create the sample app for customization examples: 

* `ApiLogicServer create --project-name=nw_sample --db_url=nw+`
* Or, open it in GitHub (use Shift + "." to view in project mode) - [click here](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/demo)

To make customizations easy to explore, search for:
* `#als` will reveal key customization examples
* `Your Code Goes Here` to find key files to customize, summarized in the table below.

</details>

&nbsp;

The ___Key Customization Files___ listed in the table below are created as stubs, intended for you to add customizations that extend the created API, Logic and Web App.

* Since they are separate files, the project can be
[rebuilt](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Project-Rebuild/) (e.g., synchronized with a revised schema), preserving your customizations.

<br>

Notes:

1. API Logic Server **CLI** provides commands you can use to ugrade your project, e.g., to add security.  See the next section.
2. You will observe the project is small.  That is because the app, logic and api are represented as **models:**
    * The [web app](ui/admin/admin.yaml) is a YAML file (about 150 lines - no html or JavaScript)
    * The [api](api/expose_api_models.py) is essentially 1 line per data model (table)

&nbsp;

# 3. Procedures

Several **CLI commands** are provided to operate on your current project.  

1. Use your IDE's terminal window to access these
2. Use `ApiLogicServer --help` to discover these

<br>

| Procedures               | Notes                              |
|:-------------------------|:-----------------------------------|
| 1. **Database Migration** | See [alembic](database/alembic/readme.md) for database migration procedures.     |
| 1. **Activating Security** | See [Security Activation](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Security-Activation/) for activating security.     |

&nbsp;

# 4. Deployment

The `devops` directory contains several scripts for creating container images, testing them, and deploying them.

Since API Logic Server creates working software (UI, API), you can do this after creating your project, to [collaborate with your team](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/DevOps-Containers-Preview/).

&nbsp;

# 5. Project Requirements

Optionally, you can **document requirements** as part of an **executable test plan**.  Test plan execution creates documentation (in markdown), including **requirements traceability** into implementation.  [See example here](test/api_logic_server_behave/reports/Behave%20Logic%20Report%20Sample.md).

&nbsp;

# 6. Project Information

This API Logic Project was created with the `ApiLogicServer create` command.

# Appendix: Key Technologies

API Logic Server is based on the projects shown below.
Consult their documentation for important information.

&nbsp;

### SARFS JSON:API Server

[SAFRS: Python OpenAPI & JSON:API Framework](https://github.com/thomaxxl/safrs)

SAFRS is an acronym for SqlAlchemy Flask-Restful Swagger.
The purpose of this framework is to help python developers create
a self-documenting JSON API for sqlalchemy database objects and relationships.

These objects are serialized to JSON and 
created, retrieved, updated and deleted through the JSON API.
Optionally, custom resource object methods can be exposed and invoked using JSON.

Class and method descriptions and examples can be provided
in yaml syntax in the code comments.

The description is parsed and shown in the swagger web interface.
The result is an easy-to-use
swagger/OpenAPI and JSON:API compliant API implementation.

### LogicBank
[Transaction Logic for SQLAlchemy Object Models](https://apilogicserver.github.io/Docs/Logic-Why/)

Use Logic Bank to govern SQLAlchemy update transaction logic - 
multi-table derivations, constraints, and actions such as sending mail or messages. Logic consists of _both:_

*   **Rules - 40X** more concise using a spreadsheet-like paradigm, and

*   **Python - control and extensibility,** using standard tools and techniques

Logic Bank is based on SQLAlchemy - it handles `before_flush` events to enforce your logic.
Your logic therefore applies to any SQLAlchemy-based access - JSON:Api, Admin App, etc.

### SQLAlchemy

[Object Relational Mapping for Python](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/).

SQLAlchemy provides Python-friendly database access for Python.

It is used by JSON:Api, Logic Bank, and the Admin App.

SQLAlchemy processing is based on Python `model` classes,
created automatically by API Logic Server from your database,
and saved in the `database` directory.

### Admin App

This generated project also contains a React Admin app:
* Multi-page - including page transitions to "drill down"
* Multi-table - master / details (with tab sheets)
* Intelligent layout - favorite fields first, predictive joins, etc
* Logic Aware - updates are monitored by business logic
