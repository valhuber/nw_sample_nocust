This explores:
1. created `api/api_discovery/graphics_services.py` and associated html to graph result
2. using get (vs post) to get data

Status:
1. graphics_services works for Post - returns data (eg, in swagger)
2. ***Issues:***
    * graphics_services does not work for Get
    * the html does not show data
